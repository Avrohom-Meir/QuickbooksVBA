    <h1>End User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>This Agreement outlines your legal relationship with us.</strong> This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") establishes a legally binding contract between you, the end user ("Licensee" or "you"), and MAT TECH ELITE LIMITED ("Licensor," "we," "us"), which governs your access to and use of the proprietary software, including all associated media, printed materials, and online or electronic documentation (collectively, the "Software"). This Agreement governs the use of the Software regardless of delivery method and supersedes any prior agreements or understandings, oral or written, between the parties.</p>

    <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p><strong>Use of the Software means acceptance.</strong> By downloading, installing, accessing, or otherwise using the Software, you signify your acceptance of this Agreement in full. If you do not agree to any of the terms, you must not install or use the Software and must delete all copies from your devices. This Agreement takes effect as soon as you demonstrate acceptance by such use.</p>

    <h2>3. Grant of License</h2>
    <p><strong>We grant a limited license, not ownership.</strong> Subject to your compliance with the terms herein, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software for internal business purposes or personal use, as applicable. This license does not include the right to sublicense, distribute, or create derivative works. You are not acquiring title or ownership to the Software itself, which remains our exclusive property.</p>

    <h2>4. Permitted Uses</h2>
    <p><strong>How you're allowed to use the Software.</strong> The Software may only be installed and operated on hardware that is owned or controlled by you. It may be used strictly in accordance with the documentation and solely for the functionality it was designed to provide—such as integration between Microsoft Access and QuickBooks Online. Any deviation from the intended functionality, including use for commercial resale or use by third parties not authorized by the Licensor, is prohibited unless explicitly covered by a separate written agreement.</p>

    <h2>5. Restrictions</h2>
    <p><strong>What you cannot do.</strong> You are prohibited from modifying, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise attempting to derive the source code or underlying algorithms of the Software. You may not rent, lease, sell, sublicense, or distribute the Software to any third party. Further, you may not use the Software for any unlawful purpose or in violation of applicable local, national, or international laws or regulations. Attempting to circumvent technical protections embedded in the Software will be deemed a breach of this Agreement.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p><strong>We retain all rights.</strong> The Software and all intellectual property rights therein—including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, and moral rights—are and will remain the sole property of the Licensor. The Licensee acknowledges that they acquire no ownership, intellectual property rights, or title in the Software through this Agreement. The Licensee agrees not to challenge the validity of the Licensor's intellectual property rights in any manner.</p>

    <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p><strong>You must protect confidential information.</strong> During your use of the Software, you may have access to confidential and proprietary information belonging to the Licensor, including trade secrets, technical specifications, algorithms, and business strategies. You agree to take all reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of such information and not to disclose or use such information for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement. This clause shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
    <p><strong>We comply with GDPR and other laws.</strong> The Licensor processes personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws including, but not limited to, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018, and where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR). By using the Software, you consent to such processing and confirm that all data provided by you is lawful, accurate, and up to date. For further information, please consult our <a href="privacy.html" class="text-blue-600">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>9. Support and Updates</h2>
    <p><strong>We may offer technical support and updates.</strong> The Licensor may, but is under no obligation to, provide technical support, error resolution, or software updates. Updates may be issued automatically or manually and may include patches, performance improvements, or additional features. Continued use of the Software after such updates constitutes acceptance of any modified terms that may accompany the update.</p>

    <h2>10. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>No guarantees are made.</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. THE LICENSOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><strong>We limit our liability.</strong> TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE LICENSOR’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID, IF ANY, FOR ACCESS TO THE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p><strong>This agreement can end.</strong> This Agreement is effective from the date you first access or install the Software and shall continue until terminated. You may terminate this Agreement by uninstalling and deleting all copies of the Software. The Licensor may terminate this Agreement without notice if you breach any terms herein. Upon termination, all rights granted to you under this Agreement shall immediately cease.</p>

    <h2>13. Export Control</h2>
    <p><strong>You are responsible for compliance.</strong> The Software may be subject to export restrictions under applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the export control laws of the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the United States. You agree to comply with all such applicable export laws and regulations and shall not export, re-export, or transfer the Software without all required government licenses and approvals.</p>

    <h2>14. Severability</h2>
    <p><strong>If one clause fails, the rest survive.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>15. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p><strong>This is the whole agreement.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and the Licensor with respect to the Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, proposals, or agreements, whether oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Any amendments must be in writing and signed by both parties.</p>

    <h2>16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p><strong>English law applies.</strong> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You hereby irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement.</p>
